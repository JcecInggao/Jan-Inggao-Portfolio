          <p>Hello, my name is Jan Inggao. I am currently attending the “Manitoba Institute of Trade and Technology” (MITT). Right now I am in the process of learning about the “Software Development” course.</p>
          <p>I was born on January 6th, 2002, in Davao city, Philippines. My family and I were able to move to Canada in 2006, when I was 4. I don’t remember much of the Philippines since I’ve been raised the majority of my life here in Canada. When my family and I first arrived, we lived in the country near niverville, until we eventually moved to Steinbach, where we currently live.</p>

        <div class="about-info left">
          <p>I was first interested in the digital world when I got my first game console, A PS2. I wondered how everything worked from behind the monitor. It wasn't until late middle school I started to dig deeper into the process of how video games are made. The high school I attended offered some coding classes, and since then, I've wanted to know more about coding.</p>
          <p>Apart from playing video games, I have picked up cooking as a hobby. Feeling the sense of accomplishment from creating something delicious and being able to share with family or friends makes cooking enjoyable to me. </p>
