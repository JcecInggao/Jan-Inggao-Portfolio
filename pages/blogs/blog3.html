          <!-- Intro -->
          <p>	Fallout: New Vegas is a classic game preceding the success of Fallout 3. A majority of New Vegas is built off of Fallout 3’s engine and game aspects. Creating your character in New Vegas shares some similarities such as “SPECIAL” and skills, while also adding a new mechanic; traits. While you may be confused about how to use these elements, hopefully this guide can give some clarity of how to utilize them.</p>
          
          <!-- Special -->
          <div class="special">
            <h3>Special:</h3>
            <p>	After creating your character’s appearance in Fallout: New Vegas, you will be soon introduced to your character's SPECIAL stats. Each letter represents an attribute about your character, and symbolizing these characteristics:</p>
            <div class="list-div">
              <div class="left">
                <ul>
                  <li>Strength</li>
                  <li>Perception</li>
                  <li>Endurance</li>
                  <li>Charisma</li>
                  <li>Agility</li>
                  <li>Luck</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

            </div>

            <p>Your SPECIAL primarily affects certain skills and perks. Additionally, SPECIAL can also affect other aspects of the game. You can set the value of each stat anywhere between 1 to 10. By default, all of these values are set to 5 with an extra 5 points for you to assign. You can relocate a SPECIAL’s stat value in order to get better use of a certain stat. The following table shows the skills affected and any additional effects.</p>
            <table>
              <tr>

              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Generally, most people like to invest their extra SPECIAL points into endurance and intelligence. Endurance allows you to take more damage, Intelligence allows you to spend more skill points on your character whenever you level up.</p>

            <!-- Skills -->
          <div class="skills">
            <h3>Skills:</h3>
            <p>Certain items and interactions in the world of New Vegas will be affected by your “skills”. Ranging from 1 to 100 skill points are given to the character whenever they level up. At the start you are given 3 “tag skill” choices. When you choose a skill to “tag”, that skill will gain an immediate boost of 15 points as well as additional items upon character completion. Your skill points level will determine how proficient you are in that skill field. The following table shows the skills in the game and some of their properties:</p>

            </table>
            <p>When choosing which skills to tag, generally only one combat skill should be focused on. These skills are considered combat skills ranked from best to worst:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Guns</li>
              <li>Energy Weapons</li>
              <li>Melee Weapons </li>
              <li>Unarmed </li>
              <li>Explosives</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Guns gives the player the most options to use in combat. Energy weapons are scarce but are powerful. Melee weapons and unarmed have some unique weapon choices but struggle with ranged fights. Explosives do massive damage, but also have the chance of hurting the player as well. Having lockpick or science as your second tag lets you access more loot. The last tag is up to the user but having repair as a last choice is a good option to make sure your weapons don’t break.</p>
