          <p>Hello, my name is Jan Inggao. I am currently attending the “Manitoba Institute of Trade and Technology” (MITT). Right now I am in the process of learning about the “Software Development” course.</p>
          <p>I was born on January 6th, 2002, in Davao city, Philippines. My family and I were able to move to Canada in 2006, when I was 4. I don’t remember much of the Philippines since I’ve been raised the majority of my life here in Canada. When my family and I first arrived, we lived in the country near niverville, until we eventually moved to Steinbach, where we currently live.</p>
          <p>Softwares and coding were first introduced to me when I was young, even though I hadn’t realized yet. My parents bought my older brother and I our first video game console, the PS2. Seeing how a small controller was able to take precise inputs and relay them back onto a screen was mind blowing as a child. Since then, I’ve been interested in what goes on behind the scenes. During high school I was able to learn more about the building blocks which made a video game work, and that’s when I was more formally introduced to the world of coding.</p>
          <p>When I’m not playing video games or studying, I tend to do some cooking. I find it relaxing just being able to let my mind loose and experiment with different flavors or try to remake something I've already made before, taste better. Just being able to see what I’m making and being able to taste my creativity leads to satisfying outcomes, or a learning experience. I don’t often cook for my whole family, typically just my younger brother and I, but when my mom lets me take over the kitchen it really makes me want to combine what I’ve known, from experience and the internet, and create a dish everyone can enjoy.</p>
